Miscellaneous R Scripts and Utilities

This repository contains a mismash of peripheral syntax files I have generated throughout my work at QIMR B (2020). 
A brief description of each file is listed here:
- Setup.R: Clears session, Checks and Calls in my typical toolkit of Packages, Creates several useful functions  
- Recode_Var.R: A function I created to speed up the data cleaning/recoding process. The function can take an indefinite number of arguments and works on both vectors and dataframes.
- Fancy_Plots.R: Displays variables over time at the individual level, coloured by cohort. Summaries also provided for Individual and Aggregate level regression parameters. 
- Export_Xlsx.R An example of how to write pre-formatted excel files from within R.
- Travelling_Salesman.R: My attempt to solve a well known NP-hard problem in computer science and operations research. Produces funky animations   
- Knoughts_and_Crosses.R: This was a fun way to learn user-interaction from within R
- WebScraper.R: Collects virtual stock information from the internet every 10 minutes and tabulates the data in an automatically updating excel spreadsheet
- Silicon_Symphony.R: Music with R, generated from 10 sample sounds syncopated via system pauses of defined length. 
- How_Low_Can_You_Go.R: Code optimization via seemless integration of R and C++. 
- Paint.R: This was a fun way to learn how to track mouse movement and mouse clicks from within R. Produces a novelty 3D animation of my name.
